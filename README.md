## Running the Project Locally

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/byaseen26/Visiter-Management-With-Facial-Recognition.git

# Navigate to backend folder
cd app-main/backend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend server
node server.js
````

### Frontend Setup

No build tools are needed. Simply open the HTML files in a browser or use Live Server.

Recommended usage with **VSCode Live Server** for a smoother experience:

```
app-main/
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html           ← Visitor registration
│   ├── checkout.html        ← Face-based checkout and feedback
│   ├── admin-login.html     ← Admin authentication
│   ├── dashboard.html       ← Admin dashboard
│   ├── blacklist.html       ← Add visitors to blacklist
│   ├── view-blacklist.html  ← View and remove blacklisted visitors
│   └── chatbot.html         ← Visitor chatbot
```

## Firebase & Email Setup

### Firebase (Firestore)

Create a Firebase project and configure Firestore with the following collections:

* `visitors`: Stores name, email, purpose, and face embeddings
* `logs`: Stores check-in/check-out records with timestamps
* `feedbacks`: Stores visitor feedback and sentiment
* `blacklist`: Stores blacklisted visitor emails and reasons

### Nodemailer Configuration

To enable OTP and email notifications:

1. Enable **2-Step Verification** for your Gmail account.
2. Generate an **App Password** via Google Account > Security > App Passwords.
3. Update the credentials in `server.js`:

```javascript
auth: {
  user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
  pass: 'your-app-password'
}
```
